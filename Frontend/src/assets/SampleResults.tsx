      authors: ["Vijay Kumar", "Martin Siegele-Brown", "Parsa Rahimi", "Matthew Aylett", "Sebastian Weidt", "Winfried Karl Hensinger"],
      abstract: "We present a novel microfabricated neutral atom source for quantum technologies that can be easily integrated onto microchip devices using well-established MEMS fabrication techniques, and contrast this to conventional off-chip ion loading mechanisms. The heating filament of the device is shown to be as small as 90×90 μm².",

      abstract: "While machine learning holds great promise for quantum technologies, most current methods focus on predicting or controlling a specific quantum system. Meta-learning approaches, however, can adapt to new systems for which little data is available, by leveraging knowledge obtained from previous data associated with similar systems.",

      abstract: "Identical two-level systems (spins), undergoing collective spontaneous emission. This is one of the simplest examples of an open quantum system dynamics problem that admits a fully analytical solution. We provide a few different approaches to derive the analytical solution valid for any time during the evolution and for any number of spins.",
